# m65script
* **State:** Experimental

This interpreter is planned as extension of the existing Basic-Language of the [Mega65](https://mega65.org). The goal is to add some control structures known from current programming languages without losing the interactive experience you know and love on these machines.
It is therefore not a cross-compiler or any pre-compilation involved.

## Credits
This project bases on the genius work by [lotabout](https://github.com/lotabout) who wrote a great tutorial about how to write an interpreter which results in a C-Interpreter which was able to execute the interpreter itself (see: [write-a-C-interpreter](https://github.com/lotabout/write-a-C-interpreter).
After examining several various existing interpreters, it was the only one that was small enough (and without unresolvable dependencies) to be cross compileable on the Mega65. I therefore chose it for my project.
